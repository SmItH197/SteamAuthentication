# SteamAuthentication

SteamAuthentication is a basic set of PHP files that enable users to login using their steam account to view protected content on your website. it creates a session using their steamid as the sessionID and checks for the session when a user visits the page. It also includes a file which allows you to use their profile information such as their avatar and online status.

## To Install

Upload the `steamauth` folder.

Open up `SteamConfig.php` 
- change `domainname` to your domain name.
- change `apikey` to your API-Key from http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey


Now in the page that you would like to use the steamauth library, add the following at the top:

```php
<?php

require 'steamauth/steamauth.php';

?>
```
And where you want the protected content to be:
```php
<?php
if(!isset($_SESSION['steamid'])) {

    loginbutton(); //login button

}  else {

    include ('steamauth/userInfo.php'); //To access the $steamprofile array
    //Protected content

    logoutbutton(); //Logout Button
}     
?>
```
By default, the logout & login buttons reload the current page, this can be changed in the SteamConfig file.

##### Be aware that naming a file in your webpage root like any file in the steamauth folder will break SteamAuth.

### Choosing a login button style

by default `loginbutton();` will display ![image](https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/signinthroughsteam/sits_02.png)

You can choose the style of the login button by specifying a variable like the following:

loginbutton("rectangle"); 

![image](https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/signinthroughsteam/sits_01.png)


loginbutton();
-OR-
loginbutton("square");

## Using Profile Variables

I have created a userInfo.php file which creates an array of ready to use variables that includes profile information of the steam user that has logged in:

* `$steamprofile['steamid']` - The user's unique SteamID
* `$steamprofile['communityvisibilitystate']` - This represents whether the profile is visible or not.
* `$steamprofile['profilestate']` - If set, indicates the user has a community profile configured (will be set to '1')
* `$steamprofile['personaname']` - Their current set profile name
* `$steamprofile['profileurl']` - The URL to their steam profile
* `$steamprofile['avatar']` - The image URL to the smallest size of their avatar (32px x 32px)
* `$steamprofile['avatarmedium']` - The image URL to the medium sized version of their avatar (64px x 64px)
* `$steamprofile['avatarfull']` - The image URL to the largest size of their avatar (184px x 184px)
* `$steamprofile['personastate']` - The user's current state, 1 - Online, 2 - Busy, 3 - Away, 4 - Snooze, 5 - looking to trade, 6 - looking to play
* `$steamprofile['realname']` - The user's "real" name
* `$steamprofile['primaryclanid']` - The user's primary group
* `$steamprofile['timecreated']` - When the account was created in unix time [Check out the wiki for help on converting to date/time](https://github.com/SmItH197/SteamAuthentication/wiki/Converting-Unix-Time-Stamp)
* `$_SESSION['steam_uptodate']` - When profile information was last updated in unix time

Please note that some of these variables may be unavailable for some users as it depends on their privacy settings. 

#### Update User Information

To refresh a user's Steam profile data use:
html: `<a href="?update">update</a>` - recommended
-OR-
php: `$_GET['update']=true;` - this must be set before `require 'steamauth/steamauth.php';`

###### Automatically refresh Steam profile data if older than specified time when they next visit your site

change line 67 of `steamauth.php` 
From:
```php
if (isset($_GET['update'])){ 
```
To:
```php
if (isset($_GET['update']) || !empty($_SESSION['steam_uptodate']) && $_SESSION['steam_uptodate']+(24*60*60) < time()){ 
```
- example shown would update if older than 24 hours.

- the numbers in the brackets `$_SESSION['steam_uptodate']+(24*60*60)` should be the maximum number of seconds before refreshing a user's Steam Profile data.
